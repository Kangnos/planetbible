            Io, or Jupiter I, is the innermost and third-largest of the four Galilean moons of the planet Jupiter.<br>
            It is the fourth-largest moon in the solar system, has the heightest density of all of them, and has<br>
            lowest amount of water (by <a href="" target="_blank" class="moreInfo">atomic ratio</a>) of any known<br>
            astronomical object in the Solar System. It was discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and was named<br>
            after the mythological character Io.
